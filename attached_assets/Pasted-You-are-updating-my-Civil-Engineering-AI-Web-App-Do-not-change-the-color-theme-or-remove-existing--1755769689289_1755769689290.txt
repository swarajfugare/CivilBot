You are updating my Civil Engineering AI Web App. 
Do not change the color theme or remove existing features. 
Only implement the fixes and new features listed below:

---

### 1. Fix Image Generator
- Currently, when clicking “Generate Image” the page reloads with a `?` in the URL, and no image appears.  
- Fix this issue so the page does not reload.  
- Ensure the GROQ API is correctly called and the generated image displays in the result box.  
- Add debugging:  
  - Log API requests and errors in the browser console.  
  - If an error occurs, show a clear UI error message: “Image generation failed. Please try again.”

---

### 2. Footer Fix
- Add some **margin above the footer** so it does not stick directly to content.  
- Ensure there is **padding inside the footer** so elements are not stuck together.  
- Add a button linking to my Instagram profile in the footer.  
- Keep the footer professional and responsive.  
- Keep developer name text: “Developed by Swaraj Fugare”.

---

### 3. Account Page – Edit Profile
- On the **Account Page**, make the “Edit Profile” button functional.  
- Allow editing of:  
  - Username  
  - Name  
  - Password  
- Do **not** allow editing of email.  
- Show a save button to update the changes (local update is fine).  

---

### 4. Chat AI Page
- AI answers should appear in a **black box with white font**.  
- Currently, after refresh the box turns white background with black font.  
- Fix so the style **always remains black background with white text**.  
- Add a feature to **upload an image to the chatbot**:  
  - User can upload an image.  
  - AI analyzes the image and answers user questions about it.  

---

### 5. Safety Page Fix
- In the Safety Page:  
  - **Recommended Actions** currently shows empty. Fix it so it displays AI-generated recommended actions from the safety analysis.  
  - **AI Safety Analysis Report** is too long:  
    - First show a **short summary** (a few lines).  
    - Then allow user to expand to see the **detailed full report**.  
    - Display the report in a **fixed-height scrollable box** to save space.

---

### 6. Plan Reader Page
- If no plan image is uploaded, show error message:  
  “Please upload a building plan image to get the analysis report.”  
- The plan report should:  
  - Show a **short summary** first (final plan report).  
  - Then allow scrolling to view the **detailed full report**.  
  - Report box must be scrollable (fixed size).  
- Add a message:  
  “For any issues or feedback, please DM the developer on Instagram.”  

---

### Rules
- Do not change the site’s color theme.  
- Do not remove or break any existing feature.  
- Only implement the fixes and features listed above.  

---

### Bot Rename
- Rename the chatbot with a professional but friendly new name:  
  **“StructuraAI”**  
  (represents structural + architecture AI, short, modern, and strong).
