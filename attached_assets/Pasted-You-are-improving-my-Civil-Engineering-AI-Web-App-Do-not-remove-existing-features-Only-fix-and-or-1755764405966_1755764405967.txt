You are improving my Civil Engineering AI Web App. 
Do not remove existing features. Only fix and organize the following:

### 1. Fix AI Image Generator
- Ensure the image generation using GROQ API works.  
- Debug why it only shows "loading" and never displays the image.  
- Correctly parse the GROQ API response and show the generated image in the UI.  
- After generation:
  - Display the image inside a card.  
  - Add a "Download" button below the image.  
  - Show error messages if something fails (e.g., invalid key, timeout).  

### 2. Organize Pages
- Make sure each page has a **clean layout** with proper headings.  
- Keep a consistent navigation bar for:
  - Home  
  - Calculators  
  - Safety  
  - Scheduler  
  - Chatbot  
  - AI Image Generator  
  - Plan Reader  
  - About Us  
- Each page should look separate, not mixed.

### 3. Plan Reader (Enhanced)
- On the **Plan Reader page**:
  - Allow user to upload a building plan (image or PDF).  
  - AI should read and summarize key details (rooms, dimensions, structure).  
  - Add a **text area** where user can type specific questions about the uploaded plan (example: “How many rooms are in this plan?”).  
  - AI should answer based on both the uploaded plan + user’s question.  
  - Show the extracted info + Q&A neatly.  
  - Add a small note: “AI interpretation may not be exact, please verify with an engineer.”  

### 4. Theme Fix
- Ensure **background and font colors always contrast**:  
  - White background → black text.  
  - Dark background → white text.  
- Apply consistently across all pages.  
- Fix buttons so they match theme and stay readable.

### 5. General
- Keep login/register, scheduler (DB persistence), calculators, and chatbot intact.  
- Do not break existing APIs.  
- Keep favicon and About Us page working.  

Final result:  
✅ Image generator loads and displays generated images correctly.  
✅ Pages are organized with navbar and clean layout.  
✅ Plan Reader allows upload + AI extraction + text Q&A.  
✅ Theme is consistent and readable everywhere.  
✅ Other features remain intact.
