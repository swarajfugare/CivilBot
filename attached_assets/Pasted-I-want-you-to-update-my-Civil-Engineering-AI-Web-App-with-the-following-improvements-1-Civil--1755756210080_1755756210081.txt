I want you to update my Civil Engineering AI Web App with the following improvements:

### 1. Civil Engineering Features
- **Unit Converter**: expand existing converter to support meters, feet, inches, cm, yards, miles, square feet, cubic meters, and tons.  
- **Material Estimator**: user enters dimensions (wall, slab, etc.) and concrete mix ratio → AI calculates required cement, sand, aggregate, water, and reinforcement steel (approximate).  
- **Cost Calculator**: allow users to input local material & labor rates → app estimates project cost.  
- **Project Scheduler**: improve existing one → schedules should be saved in the database per user (linked to login). Enable users to download/export schedules as PDF/Excel.  
- **Reports Generator**: AI should generate formatted reports like:  
  - Daily Progress Report  
  - Material Requirement Sheet  
  - Project Schedule PDF  
- **Knowledge Base**: add a simple "Learn Civil Engineering" section where AI answers from common IS codes/standards and best practices.  
- **Dark/Light Theme Toggle**: add a toggle for UI between light and dark mode.  

### 2. AI Chat Behavior
- AI should use **conversation history** for answers (remember context within the chat session).  
- AI should give **short, clear, main-point answers** instead of very long paragraphs.  
- For longer explanations, add a **"More Details" button** that expands the response if the user wants.  

### 3. UI/UX Updates
- Update chatbot UI → add typing animation, bubble style for messages.  
- Ensure font colors adapt properly:  
  - On white backgrounds → black font  
  - On dark backgrounds → white font  
- Add developer credit in footer: "Developed by Swaraj Fugare" with a link to Instagram profile: [https://www.instagram.com/swaraj.fugare_23/](https://www.instagram.com/swaraj.fugare_23/).  
- Set favicon of a construction helmet (use my existing favicon.ico file).  

### 4. Login & User Data
- Keep the simple login/register system.  
- Ensure each user’s data (schedules, saved calculations, reports) is stored in DB and available after logout/login.

Please update my app code with all of the above features and improvements.
